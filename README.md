# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Python Tkinter GUI

A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's `tkinter` library. This project is a GUI adaptation of the classic console version.

## 🧠 Overview

This game allows two players to take turns playing Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (`X` or `O`) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If the board is full and no one wins, the game ends in a tie.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Interactive 3x3 grid using buttons.
- 👥 Two-player support with turn switching.
- 🏆 Win and tie detection.
- 🔄 Restart prompt after game ends.
- 📱 Clean and responsive UI using `tkinter`.
